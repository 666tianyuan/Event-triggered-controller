# Event-triggered-control
Simple examples for Event-triggered controller for network controlled system(NCS):

Event-triggered scheme has been proposed to reduce the communication load in the network .

A few examples of Matlab code for discrete and continuous time systems:

1- system state is available to sensor:

2- Output feedback, event-triggered PID controller

3-Optimal (state feedback) control

4-MPC

5-Robust (Tube) MPC
