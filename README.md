# Event-triggered-control
Simple examples for Event-triggered controller for network controlled system(NCS):

Event-triggered control is developed to reduce the communication load in networked control systems. This means that system output or actuator signals are only transmitted over the network when an event-triggering condition is violated which is designed such that a certain control performance can be guaranteed.

A few examples of Matlab code for discrete and continuous time systems:

1- system state is available to sensor:

2- Output feedback, event-triggered PID controller

3-Optimal (state feedback) control

4-MPC

5-Nonlinear MPC

6-Robust (Tube) MPC
